# Alexa-Toll
I built this Alexa app to learn how Alexa apps work, and to help me with my daily decision making
for the route to take to and from work.  Google maps usually recommended two different routes to
take, one with tolls, and one without tolls.  Sometimes, the route times were similar, so I took the
route without tolls, but often, the route with tolls was faster.  This app helped me decide which route
to take, based on how much extra time I was willing to drive to avoid the tolls.
